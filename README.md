# express-sql-server

## A back-end NodeJS and ExpressJS application 
- It consumes a third party api: https://fakestoreapi.com/, then stores the data into a connected local MySQL database.
- It offers a range of microservices for the data stored.
- It's made with a purpose to connect and supply the microservices needed for my MockStore front-end projeck.
